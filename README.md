# Law Wheel Animation Made of Entirely HTML5 and CSS3

A re-do of the animated law wheel (https://github.com/thecodercody/falun and live demo: https://thelawwheel.herokuapp.com), but using only HTML5 and CSS3 and without any image files or JavaScript.  This was done as a personal challenge to see if I could do it; I was indeed successful.
